# Project Ideas

## Easy Onboarding ("normyboarding")

- NFT
- DAO
- DeFi

each topic above would have the same treatment, answering the questions grouped in 3 parts … per topic, so all three question groups for NFT, all three groups for DAO, etc

1. in 500-1000 words: `why` does this matter?  why now?  how am i supposed to think about it?  how should i pay attention to / keep up with it? 
2. in 500-1000 words: `what` can i do to try it?  where do i use it?  when do i use it?  what should i even do with it?  what are other people doing with it?
3. in 500-1000 words: `how` is it made exactly?  how can i make it myself?  where i can learn about how it’s made and how to make it?  who makes it?

*part 1 would be some text and diagrams, maybe a brief 1-2 min 
explainer video as alternative media to the text*

*part 2 would be a list of links to dApps to use, maybe a 30-60 second screen recorded walkthrough of buying an NFT on Paras or farming rewards on ref.finance*

*part 3 would be a list of links to sample code, courses that people could take, self-paced courses and facilitated courses, certifications, student testimonials, feedback, etc*


this has been a burning priority for a few months now so any help we can get on shipping this would be great
